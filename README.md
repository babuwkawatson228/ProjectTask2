# ProjectTask2
Task2 for a Java using Spring Boot with a Swagger interface, Student Yaroslav Pilhui (SID: 77158, group 2)

For this task we had to create an application using Spring Initializr to send varius requests and then to analyze responces.

The request are different manipulations with "products" - we are looking at 4 core HTTP methods:

1. GET - to retrieve
2. POST - to create
3. PUT - to update
4. DELETE - to delete

Throughout the creation of this application we had to test whether Rest API is working correcrly. 

On early steps I was using the Postman application, on the following screenshot you can find a POST request in JSON format.
